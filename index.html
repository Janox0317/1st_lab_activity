    <h2> On one lovely evening, a young boy was laughing and playing in the garden. He was chasing butterflies as he ran across the beautiful flowers. He also saw a bulky cow who was trying to keep a bug away by swirling her tail. The boy saw different animals like frogs, fish, etc. The child laughed and enjoyed the whole scene a lot. He then saw a small brown squirrel running here and there, he tried to follow it and reached a flower bed. It had beautiful red roses, the boy tried to pick one flower but the thorns plugged his finger. He ran to his mother crying and told her about everything. Listening to this his mother explained that we must not put any sort of harm to nature instead we should help it to grow. The boy learned a new lesson and was very happy.

    <h3> On one splendid evening, when the weather was very pleasant, a boy was playing in the garden. He was running left and right after some beautiful butterflies. He looked around and saw colorful flowers of all shapes and sizes. He then saw a shiny green frog hopping around, he ran after it and reached near a small pond. He saw small golden fishes in the pond. Near the pond, he saw a big black and white cow calmy chewing green grass. The boy noticed a little bug teasing the cow. The cow then swirled its tail back and forth to keep the bug away. Looking at it the boy laughed loudly and said "Wow! Nature is so amazing. It has the power to attract anyone to itself." Suddenly he saw a notorious little squirrel running here and there, he chased after it and reached near a flower bed. The flower bed had beautiful red roses that smelled wonderful. Looking at the rose the boy tried to pick them and got plugged by a thorn. His finger began to bleed and he felt unbearable pain. He immediately ran to his mother crying. The mother asked him" What happened? why are you crying so loudly". The boy replied" I was plucking the beautiful rose but the thorn plugged my fingers." The mother smiled and explained "Dear son, the mistake is yours. You should not pluck flowers. God created them beautifully to witness them, we must not destroy them. You must learn that we should never interrupt the natural process of god. The boy stopped crying and said" I have understood mom, I will never do it again" The mother asked, "Dear son tell me what have you learned today?". The boy explained, "We must save all the living beings on this planet. We should not harm them. Useless interference with nature is dangerous. It may damage the people in the long term.
    </h3>
    <h4> The moral of this beautiful story is that we humans must understand and value our nature. We should not exploit it blindly. The life of each and every living being on this earth matters, so we must let them live and not interfere or destroy them for our own sake. We may satisfy ourselves by exploiting nature's present, but it will definitely harm us in the near future. As it is said, "one shall reap what it sows". This is the lesson of the nature short story.
